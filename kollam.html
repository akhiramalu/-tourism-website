      <p>Kollam (erstwhile Quilon) is a southern district of Kerala, located 70 km north of the state’s capital Thiruvananthapuram. It is flanked by the Arabian sea on the west, Tamil Nadu on the east, Alapuzha and Pathanamthitta districts on the north and Thiruvananthapuram district on the south. Housing a population of over 2.6 million, Kollam is one of the more densely peopled districts of India. The head quarters of the district administration is centred at Kollam City, the district’s capital. Administratively, the district is composed of two revenue divisions viz. Kollam and Punalur with three taluks each under them.

        Like the rest of Kerala, Kollam is climactically temperate with a generally sunny weather peaking in heat during April-May. The monsoon falls from June to September. The soil is varyingly loamy, laterite and forest at the coastal regions, mainland and the forest areas respectively.
        
        The heart land of Kollam is naturally veined by the Ashtamudi lake, a massive, multi-branched water body, which is also a popular boating attraction for tourists. This and the Kollam canal cutting through the city give Kollam a place of prominence in the waterway systems of the country. A number of islands of varying sizes beautifully spot the vast expanse of the lake. The city is graced by beaches where people go to spend quiet evenings. Kollam also has a considerably large forest cover on its eastern side making home for several eco tourism projects like Shenduruni, Thenmala, Palaruvi etc.</p>

        <p class="card-text">This large lake is totally devoid of any flora and there is no plant growth in the waters of the lake. A larva called “Cavaborus” abounds in the lake. They eat up the viruses and bacteria in the water thus contributing substantially to the high degree of purity of the water. Shasthamcotta Lake supplies drinking water to approximately 10 million people including the population of the Municipality of Kollam.</p>
