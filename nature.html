    <h1>Beauty of Kerala</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>Kerala’s ecosystems offer a diverse array of flora and fauna, inviting nature enthusiasts to explore its abundant wildlife. Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled in the Cardamom Hills, is one of India’s premier protected areas, home to elephants, tigers, and exotic bird species. A boat safari on Periyar Lake offers visitors a rare chance to witness elephants bathing along the shore and the occasional glimpse of an elusive Bengal tiger.

        The forests here, rich in medicinal plants and herbs, have nurtured Kerala’s Ayurvedic tradition for centuries. Not only is Periyar a sanctuary for animals, but it also serves as a green pharmacy for Ayurvedic healers who collect plants to create natural medicines. Exploring these forests provides a glimpse into how deeply nature and wellness are interwoven in Kerala’s culture.
        
        Birdwatchers will find paradise in the Thattekad Bird Sanctuary, home to over 300 bird species, including the Malabar trogon and Sri Lanka frogmouth. Visitors can wander along forest trails with expert guides who help spot elusive species, offering a peaceful and meditative way to connect with Kerala’s natural bounty.</p>
